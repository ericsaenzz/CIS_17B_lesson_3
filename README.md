C++ application that implements bankAccount
Error and Exception handling

# Functionality
This program is designed to allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. However, certain actions can lead to errors, which must be handled using exceptions:

Overdrawing funds: Users should not be allowed to withdraw more than the available balance.
Negative deposits: Depositing a negative amount should raise an exception.
Invalid account operations: Transactions on closed accounts should not be allowed.

The functionality is similar to programming assignment 1 however there is more dynamic error handling, you can now delete your account and the program utilizes smart pointers
